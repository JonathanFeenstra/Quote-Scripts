## How do I edit something in the launcher?

Before you even think of editing anything, check if any branches by the name of `rewrite`, `update` or alike exist.

If there aren't any, there is a list of requirements you must meet before editing.

- [ ] 1. Is your edit contributing to the launcher? (Adding comments such as like "Credits" and crediting yourself is not contributional)
- [ ] 2. Is your edit minor? (Grammar fix, rewording, etc.)
- [ ] 3. Is your edit of dire importance? (Launcher breaking when clicking X and Y)
- [ ] 4. Is your edit going to break the launcher?
- [ ] 5. Are the elements of the launcher you edited consistent with the rest of the launcher?

If you meet all of the listed requirements, your next course of action is to open a pull request and edit what you wish to edit.
You are then to copy-paste the list from above and put X/leave empty where it belongs.

Example:


#### Pull Request 31: Fixed dependencies. (Give a brief title over what you changed)

```md
In this Pull Request, I changed X and Y.
